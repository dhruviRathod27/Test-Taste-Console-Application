Solution i've found is 
firstly 
Gravity field was missing in the moon class so added that.
we were not getting the gravity field from the API 
so i addded the gravity into the query parameter
changed the data type of Average Gravity from float to double 
and calculted an average gravity.

for the alternative solution will be for calculating the average gravity other than that all the other steps are mandatory.
